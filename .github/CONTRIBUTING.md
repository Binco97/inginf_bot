### Rules to Code

* For indentation, use Tabs instead Spaces
* For the strings delimiter, use `'`
* If you want insert a variable into a string, use the concatenation (_i.e._ `$var2 = 'text' . $var1 . 'text'`)
* Every special character (`'`, `"`, `\`, etc.) must be preceded by `\`, also if not necessary
* Use of keyword `global` instead of `$GLOBALS` array if there is a reference to a global variable
